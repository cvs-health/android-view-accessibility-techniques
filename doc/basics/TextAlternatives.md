# Text Alternatives
All informative non-text content must have a text alternative associated with it, generally via the `contentDescription` property. Providing text alternatives is required by the WCAG [Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-Text Content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content). 

## Informative non-text content

Examples of informative non-text content include `ImageView` elements that convey information and `ImageButton` controls without text. Use a non-empty `android:contentDescription` property value to provide the text alternative.

```xml
<ImageView
    ...
    android:src="@drawable/ic_sunrise_fill"
    android:contentDescription="Sunrise"
/>
```

```xml
<ImageButton
    android:id="@+id/image_button_example_6"
    ...
    android:layout_gravity="center_vertical"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_share_fill"
    android:contentDescription="Share" />
```

## Decorative non-text content

Purely decorative content that conveys no meaning must be marked as such with either a null `contentDescription` or `importantForAccessibility="no"`. 

```xml
<ImageView
    ...
    android:src="@drawable/ic_sprout_fill"
    android:contentDescription="@null"/>
```

```xml
<ImageView
    ...
    android:src="@drawable/ic_sprout_fill"
    android:importantForAccessibility="no"/>
```

## Avoid redundancy in grouped content

Informative non-text content that is redundant with adjacent text content should be grouped with that text content, rather than given a redundant `contentDescription`. Using `importantForAccessibility="yes"` on the enclosing group layout (and nulling out the non-text content's `contentDescription`) is the simplest way to achieve this.


```xml
<!-- Good example of grouping content: 
     Enclosing LinearLayout has importantForAccessibility="yes" and
     check mark ImageView has null contentDescription. -->
<LinearLayout
    ...
    android:importantForAccessibility="yes"
    android:orientation="horizontal">
    
    <ImageView
        ...
        android:contentDescription="@null"
        android:src="@drawable/ic_check_fill"
        app:tint="@color/success_green" />
                
    <com.google.android.material.textview.MaterialTextView
        ...
        android:text="Good example of grouping redundant content" />
</LinearLayout>
```

Another alternative for grouping images and text content is to set the `contentDescription` on the enclosing layout group layout. Sometimes this approach is preferable, as is illustrated in the [Content Group Replacement](../grouping/ContentGroupReplacement.md) sample.

## Describing "decorative" images

Although you should never put a non-null `contentDescription` on a purely decorative image, sometimes there are arguments that an apparently decorative image provides tone or emotional content to a screen that should be described for screen reader users. This is a judgement call for the app's designer.

## Handling complex images

Complex images, such as charts and graphs, should have a concise `contentDescription` covering their purpose, but their details also need to be fully presented in the app's text nearby. (If necessary, this text may be on a separate screen that can be easily navigated to using a control near the image). The accessibility of such data visualizations is a separate (and deep) topic.

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
