# Text Resizing and Reflow
TextView controls in Android should obey the following rules:

1. Use `sp` ("scaled pixel") units for `android:textSize`.
2. Use `layout_height="wrap_content"` (or `layout_height="0dp"` in a `ConstraintLayout`).
3. Do not set `android:maxLines` (or any other `max...` property) -- unless some mechanism exists to make the full text available.

These steps are required to support WCAG [Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text) and [Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow).

The first rule insures that text will scale when the system text size is adjusted in the Android Settings app "Accessibility > Text and display > Font size" screen (Google devices) or "Accessibility > Visibility enhancements > Font size and style" screen (Samsung devices).

The second rule insures that the `TextView` itself does not cut off the top or bottom of the text displayed. (Similarly, do not put `TextView` controls in a fixed-height layout container.)

The third rule insures that the entire text can display by reflowing vertically if it grows longer than a fixed number of lines -- unless some other mechanism (like a link to the full text or an expandable view) is provided.



```xml
<TextView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:textSize="16sp"
    android:text="This text will resize and reflow properly."
/>
```

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in this example is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
