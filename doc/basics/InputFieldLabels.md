# Input Field Labels
All input fields must have associated text labels, as required by WCAG [Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships). Android uses several techniques to associate fields and labels, depending on the control type.

## Use the `android:labelFor` property to associate `TextView` labels with controls

The most common and generic technique for associating labels with input field controls is to add the `android:labelFor` property to a TextView, indicating what control field is being labeled by that text.

```xml
<TextView
    ...
    android:labelFor="@+id/name"
    android:text="Name" />
<EditText
    android:id="@id/name"
    ... />
```

## Use the `android:hint` property for `TextInputLayout` controls

The `TextInputLayout`/`TextInputEditText` combined input field control associates the label with the text input field using the `android:hint` property.

```xml
<com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout
    android:id="@+id/name_layout"
    ...
    android:hint="Name" >
    <com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputEditText
        ... />
</com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout>
```

## Use the `android:text` property for self-labeling controls

The `CheckBox`, `SwitchCompat`/`SwitchMaterial`, `RadioButton`, and `Button` controls all use the `android:text` property to display a label associated with the control.

Note that `RadioButton` controls must always be enclosed in a `RadioGroup` control for proper operation and accessibility.

```xml
<CheckBox
    android:id="@+id/labels_checkbox"
    ...
    android:text="Show labels" />
```

```xml
<androidx.appcompat.widget.SwitchCompat
    android:id="@+id/labels_switch"
    ...
    android:text="Show labels" />
```

```xml
<RadioGroup
    ...>
    
    <RadioButton
        android:id="@+id/radiobutton_on"
        ...
        android:text="Labels On" />
    <RadioButton
        android:id="@+id/radiobutton_off"
        ...
        android:text="Labels Off" />
</RadioGroup>
        
```

```xml
<Button
    android:id="@+id/button_associated"
    ...
    android:text="Submit" />
```

## Labeling RadioButtons with group labels

In addition to applying a field label to each `RadioButton` using `android:text`, it is important to associate the radio button group label to each individual `RadioButton` in order to supply its selection context.

This can done by manipulating each `RadioButton`'s `AccessibilityNodeInfo` object with the `setLabeledBy()` method (`addLabeledBy()` in Android 16+). Doing that can be simplified with the following extension method:

```kotlin
fun RadioButton.setRadioGroupHeading(radioGroupLabelView: View) {
    ViewCompat.setAccessibilityDelegate(this, object : AccessibilityDelegateCompat() {
        override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(
            host: View,
            info: AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat
        ) {
            super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)
            
            // Technique: Use setLabeledBy() to associate a group label View with a RadioButton.
            // This is done in addition to setting the RadioButton's field label with android:text.
            info.setLabeledBy(radioGroupLabelView)
        }
    })
}
```

This extension function associates a group label's `View` with `RadioButton`s as follows:

```kotlin
binding.radiobutton1.setRadioGroupHeading(binding.radioGroupLabel)
binding.radiobutton2.setRadioGroupHeading(binding.radioGroupLabel)
```

A group label can also be associated with `RadioButton`s by applying the `setContainerTitle()` method to the `RadioGroup`'s `AccessibilityNodeInfo` object. Doing that can be simplified with the following extension method:

```kotlin
fun ViewGroup.setContainerTitle(containerTitle: CharSequence) {
    ViewCompat.setAccessibilityDelegate(this, object : AccessibilityDelegateCompat() {
        override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(
            host: View,
            info: AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat
        ) {
            super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)

            // Key technique: Use setContainerTitle() to associate a group label with a ViewGroup.
            // This group label will be applied to all of the container's content Views.
            info.containerTitle = containerTitle
        }
    })
}
```

This extension function associates a group label string with a `RadioGroup` as follows:

```kotlin
binding.radioGroup.setContainerTitle("Radio Group Label")
```

One difference between these two group labeling techniques is that `labeledBy` is announced by TalkBack on every control so labeled, while a `containerTitle` is only announced on the first control in the container that receives TalkBack focus.

## Labeling `Slider` and `RangeSlider` controls

Labeling `Slider` and `RangeSlider` controls is more complex and has known issues. What _must_ be done to label a `Slider` for accessibility is to provide a `contentDescription` for the control; otherwise, a `Slider` will not be properly focused or announced by the TalkBack screen reader. 

However, providing a `contentDescription` does _not_ provide a descriptive visual label for the `Slider`, which is required in addition to the programmatically-associated label text by WCAG [Success Criterion 2.4.6 Headings and Labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#headings-and-labels). Such a visual label can be created using a separate `TextView`, and should probably be associated with the `Slider` using the `android:labelFor` property. 

(That said, since the `contentDescription` is required and may duplicate the visual label text, using `labelFor` can produce a problematic user experience. Be sure to test your resulting user interface using a screen reader. See [[Slider\] ContentDescription causes the talkback to not read correctly #2348](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/issues/2348) and [[Slider\] LabelFor does not work #2347](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/issues/2347) for more details about the known issues with `Slider` control labeling.)

Note when testing that Slider controls have two parts: the outer slider itself and one or two "thumb" controls. The outer slider will announce itself in TalkBack with something like "Quality rating, Slider. Double-tap to activate." Ignore the "Double-tap to activate" action on the outer slider control -- it doesn't do anything -- instead swipe right (Next) in TalkBack to get to the thumb control, which has the slider's value and adjustment actions, such as '"Swipe up" or "Swipe down" to adjust.'

```xml
<!-- One technique is associating the visual label TextView with the
     Slider control using android:labelFor. -->
<TextView
    ...
    android:text="Rating"
    android:labelFor="@+id/rating_slider" />
    
<!-- The other, essential technique is setting 
     android:contentDescription on the Slider control. -->
<com.google.android.material.slider.Slider
    android:id="@+id/rating_slider"
    ...
    android:value="5.0"
    android:valueFrom="0.0"
    android:valueTo="10.0"
    android:stepSize="1.0"
    android:contentDescription="Rating" />
```

```xml
<!-- One technique is associating the visual label TextView with
    the RangeSlider control using android:labelFor. -->
<TextView
    ...
    android:text="Price range"
    android:labelFor="@+id/price_range_slider" />

<!-- The other, essential technique is setting
     android:contentDescription on the RangeSlider control. -->
<com.google.android.material.slider.RangeSlider
    android:id="@+id/price_range_slider_associated"
    ...
    android:valueFrom="0.0"
    android:valueTo="100.0"
    android:stepSize="5.0"
    android:contentDescription="Price Range" />
```
