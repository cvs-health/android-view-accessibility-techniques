# Focusable, Clickable Controls
If an active Android control is touchable, it must set `android:focusable="true"` and apply an `onClickListener`, not just an `onTouchListener`. These two steps are required to support the WCAG requirements [Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard) and [Success Criterion 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pointer-cancellation).

Some controls, such as `Button` and `ImageButton` are focusable by default, so do not require adding `android:focusable="true"`; however, any typically non-focusable element, such as `ImageView` needs to be made focusable or a keyboard and Switch Access may be unable to focus on it.

(For some recent versions of Android, only applying the `onClickListener` is necessary, but for backward-compatibility, set `android:focusable="true"` as well.)

```xml
<ImageView
    android:id="@+id/show_hello_world"
    ...
    android:focusable="true"
    android:contentDescription="Show 'Hello world!' snackbar" />
```
```kotlin
binding.showHelloWorld.setOnClickListener {
    Snackbar.make(binding.root, "Hello world!", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG).show()
}
```

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
