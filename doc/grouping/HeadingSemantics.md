# Heading Semantics
Top-level heading text must be marked as an accessibility heading. This supports the WCAG [Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships), which requires information conveyed through presentation (such as larger-sized heading text) to be programmatically available to accessibility services.

Two techniques can be used to mark content as a heading for accessibility.

* For API level 28 (Android 9) and later, set `android:accessibilityHeading="true"`.
    * Note: This property may be applied to `TextView` or to layout elements that group heading content.
* For support below API level 28, apply an `AccessibilityDelegateCompat` to a `View` using `ViewCompat.setAccessibilityDelegate()` that sets the `AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat.isHeading` property to `true`. 

```kotlin
ViewCompat.setAccessibilityDelegate(
    binding.heading, 
    object : AccessibilityDelegateCompat() {
        override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(
            host: View,
            info: AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat
        ) {
            super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)
            info.isHeading = true
        }
    }
)
```

The following extension function simplifies applying the heading property to a `View`.

```kotlin
fun View.setAsAccessibilityHeading() {
    ViewCompat.setAccessibilityDelegate(
        this, 
        object : AccessibilityDelegateCompat() {
            override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(
                host: View,
                info: AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat
            ) {
                super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)
                info.isHeading = true
            }
        }
    )
}
```

Marking an element as an accessibility heading then becomes a simple application of the extension function.

```kotlin
binding.heading.setAsAccessibilityHeading()
```

Notes:

* One complication of heading semantics on Android is that list items in the standard list classes (such as `RecyclerView`) can not be accessibility headings; the `isHeading` property is simply ignored for list items. Logically, this makes a certain sense since list `ViewHolder` items are not permanent, but are recycled as the list is scrolled.
* Never use `android:contentDescription` to append an accessibility property like "Heading" to a `View`. It may sound almost correct in TalkBack, but doesn't work correctly.
* Native Android apps do not have multiple heading levels. Only mark top-level headings as a heading.
