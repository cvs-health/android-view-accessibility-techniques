# Accessibility Action Labels
Standard accessibility actions, such as activating a control using an Assistive Technology like TalkBack by double-tapping, can have their label text customized to improve the user experience.

In this way, a button that might normally announce its action as "Double-tap to activate" can instead be programmed to say "Double-tap to show details" or "Double-tap to sign in". 

(Note how assigning a custom action label does not change TalkBack's standard click action description "Double-tap to ...", only what is said after that point.)

A customized action label is added to a button by assigning an `AccessibilityDelegate` that applies `addAction()` to the preexisting standard click action's id (`AccessibilityAction.ACTION_CLICK.getId()`) with the custom label text (in this case, `"show details"`):

```kotlin
binding.showDetailsButton.accessibilityDelegate = object : View.AccessibilityDelegate() {
    override fun onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(
        host: View,
        info: AccessibilityNodeInfo
    ) {
        super.onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo(host, info)
        info.addAction(
            AccessibilityAction(
                AccessibilityAction.ACTION_CLICK.getId(),
                "show details"
            )
        )
    }
}
```

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
