# UX Change Announcements
All user experiences changes resulting from user interactions or automatic updates must be announced to accessibility services (such as TalkBack) in order to support the WCAG [Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#status-messages). (That said, it is reasonable and acceptable to rate-limit the announcement of automatic updates or they can overwhelm the user.)

There are two key techniques for providing UX change announcements: `accessibilityLiveRegion` and `announceForAccessibility()`.

## Use the `android:accessibilityLiveRegion` property to announce field value changes

The `android:accessibilityLiveRegion` property indicates a field that should announce its value whenever it is changed. This property has three possible values: `"polite"` waits for any announcement in progress to complete, `"assertive"` interrupts any announcement in progress, and `"none"` indicates that the field should not announce its value.

Note that fields with `accessibilityLiveRegion` active will announce their value when they are made visible, but no announcement is made when they are made not visible. (See the next technique for a way to handle that.)

In the following example, whenever the `counter` field's text is updated, its new value will be announced to accessibility services.

```xml
<TextView
    android:id="@+id/counter"
    ...
    android:accessibilityLiveRegion="polite"
    tools:text="Counter: 0"/>
```

## Use the `View.announceForAccessibility()` method to announce events from code

The `View.announceForAccessibility()` method can be called at any point from code to make an announcement. This announcement is always "assertive."

The following example shows code announcing when a waiting indicator is dismissed using `announceForAccessibility()`. 

```kotlin
binding.waitingIndicator.announceForAccessibility(
    "Loading completed."
)
binding.waitingIndicator.hide()
```

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
