# RatingBar Controls
To create interactive rating bar controls, i.e. "star ratings," that announce their name, role, and value in accordance with the WCAG [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#name-role-value) and work well with assistive technologies, use the standard Android `RatingBar` control. Custom approaches are likely to be less accessible.

In XML, declare the `RatingBar` (in this case, using `AppCompatRatingBar`) and set the following properties:

* `android:id` in order to refer to this control in code.
* `android:layout_width="wrap_content` -- bad things happen if "match_parent" is used.
* `android:numStars` sets the number of maximum rating value allowed.
* `android:stepSize` sets the increment interval; defaults to 0.5, but best to set it explicitly.
* `android:rating` sets the initial rating value.

For example:

```xml
<androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatRatingBar
    android:id="@+id/ratingbar1"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:numStars="5"
    android:stepSize="0.25"
    android:rating="0"
    />
```

The appearance of a `RatingBar` can also be controlled using:

* `android:progressTint` - the color of the selected portion of the `RatingBar` icons.
* `android:progressBackgroundTint` - the color of the unselected portion of the `RatingBar` icons.
* `android:progressDrawable` - a drawable, generally a layer list, for the `RatingBar` icons themselves.

For consistency across your app, these properties should be wrapped in a `style` resource, derived from the parent `Widget.AppCompat.RatingBar`.

In code, assign an `OnRatingBarChangeListener` to capture control value changes. 

For example:

```kotlin
binding.ratingbar1.setOnRatingBarChangeListener { ratingBar: RatingBar, rating: Float, fromUser: Boolean ->
    if (fromUser) { 
        // Testing fromUser avoids potential loops when control value is changed programmatically.
        // Update ViewModel or other controls here...
    }
}
```

Also, set any dynamically-determined initial control values, such as a rating from a database or API (not shown).

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
