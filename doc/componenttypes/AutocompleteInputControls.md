# Autocomplete Input Controls
Autocomplete input controls provide a drop-down list of suggested values, based on the user's present input text. To make autocomplete input controls conform to the WCAG [Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#name-role-value), it is best to implement them using the standard `AutoCompleteTextView` control; custom approaches are likely to be less accessible.

Implementation of `AutoCompleteTextView` is discussed in [Provide auto-complete suggestions](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/keyboard-input/style#AutoComplete) and [AutoCompleteTextView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AutoCompleteTextView). Use the property `android:completionThreshold` to control how many characters the user must type before automatic completion options are displayed.

There are two common approaches to incorporating `AutoCompleteTextView` into a layout with a visual label: beside a `TextView` or within a `TextInputLayout`.

## `AutoCompleteTextView` labeled by a `TextView`

If `AutoCompleteTextView` is accompanied by a sibling `TextView` as its visual label, be sure to use `android:labelFor` on the `TextView` indicating the autocomplete control's `android:id`.

```xml
<TextView
    ...
    android:text="US State"
    android:labelFor="@+id/auto_complete_us_state" />

<AutoCompleteTextView
    android:id="@+id/auto_complete_us_state"
    ...
    android:completionThreshold="1">
```

## `AutoCompleteTextView` labeled by a `TextInputLayout`

If `AutoCompleteTextView` is incorporated into a `TextInputLayout` to provide its visual label, apply `style="@style/Widget.MaterialComponents.TextInputLayout.FilledBox.ExposedDropdownMenu"` to get a "drop-down menu" appearance.

```xml
<com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout
    ...
    android:hint="US State"
    style="@style/Widget.MaterialComponents.TextInputLayout.FilledBox.ExposedDropdownMenu" >

    <AutoCompleteTextView
        ...
        android:completionThreshold="1"
        android:inputType="textCapWords" />

</com.google.android.material.textfield.TextInputLayout>
```

(Note: The hard-coded text shown in these examples is only used for simplicity. _Always_ use externalized string resource references in actual code.)
